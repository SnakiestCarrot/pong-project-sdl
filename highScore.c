    Part of the advanced requirements to have highscores.

    The game tracks 3 highscores, where the user upon beating
    a previous top 3 score, can input their name (3 capital letters)
    and it will be saved in the "HiScores" submenu on the splashscreen.
    The saving of highscores is volatile, they will be reset if
    the system memory loses power.
